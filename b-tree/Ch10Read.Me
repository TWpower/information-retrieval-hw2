This Read.Me file accompanies the programs for Chapter 10, Data Structures: A Pseudocode Approach Using C-------------------------------------------------------This chapter has only a C implementation of the ADT; there are no C applications. As presented in the text,the ADT is incomplete because we left several of thefunctions to be developed. You will need to write themto run the ADT.There is a test driver enclosed. It is found in	P10Drvr.c.In addition to the test-driver menu-driven user interface, there is an undocumented user option, create a tree that inserts 19 nodes into the tree. It is invoked by enteringan exclamation point (!) in the option menu.-------------------------------------------------------Programs:P10-01.h	B-tree DeclarationP10-02.h	B-tree Search Application Interface P10-03.h	Internal Search FunctionP10-04.h	B-tree Traverse Application Interface P10-05.h	Internal Traverse FunctionP10-06.h	B-tree Insert Application Interface P10-07.h	Internal Insert FunctionP10-08.h	Internal Split Node FunctionP10-09.h	B-tree Delete Application Interface P10-10.h	Internal Delete FunctionP10-11.h	Internal Delete Middle FunctionP10-12.h	Internal Reflow FunctionP10-13.h	Internal Borrow Right FunctionP10-14.h	Internal Combine Nodes FunctionHeader File:P10BTree.hTest Driver:P10Drvr.cG & F August 2004
